[Commits](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/v0.1.27...v0.1.31)

The patch versions (`v0.1.29` - `v0.1.31`) that have been released on the [v0.1.x branch](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/tree/0.1.x), to reflect the changed maintainers, **are branched off from [`v0.1.27`](#0127) so they don't include the breaking changes introduced in [`xmldom-alpha@v0.1.28`](#0128)**:

## Maintainer changes

After the last commit to the original repository <https://github.com/jindw/xmldom> on the 9th of May 2017, the first commit to <https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom> is from the 19th of December 2019. [The fork has been announced in the original repository on the 2nd of March 2020.](https://github.com/jindw/xmldom/issues/259)

The versions listed below have been published to one or both of the following packages:
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom-alpha>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom>

It is currently not planned to continue publishing the `xmldom-alpha` package.

The new maintainers did not invest time to understand changes that led to the last `xmldom` version [`0.1.27`](#0127) published by the original maintainer, but consider it the basis for their work.
A timeline of all the changes that happened from that version until `0.3.0` is available in <https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/62>. Any related questions should be asked there.
